# CS17 Fall 2023 Website

## Making Updates

* To release assignments, labs, or projects, you can usually find that in `src/Info`.

* Announcements can be updated in `src/Pages/HomePage/HomePage.js`.

* Commit changes. Pull and merge changes if necessary.

* Run the website locally with `npm start` to make sure new changes don't break anything. Go to http://localhost:3000/ in a browser.

* Push changes.

* `npm run deploy` to actually deploy changes to the website. This connects to the gh-pages branch.
